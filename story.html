                <h3> Storyline </h3>
                <p> America, 1899. The end of the wild west era has begun as lawmen hunt down the last remaining outlaw
                    gangs. Those who will not surrender or succumb are killed. </p>
                <p>After a robbery goes badly wrong in the western town of Blackwater, Arthur Morgan and the Van der
                    Linde gang are forced to flee. With federal agents and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing
                    on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland of America
                    in
                    order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must make
                    a
                    choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.</p>
                <h3> Game description </h3>
                <p> Set in a fictional recreation of the American Old West in 1899, <cite> Red Dead Redemption 2 (RDR2)
                    </cite> focuses on the life of Arthur Morgan and his position in the notorious Van der Linde gang.
                    The game follows the gang's decline as they are pursued by lawmen, fellow gangs and Pinkerton
                    agents.
                    The narrative revolves around the characters of Dutch van der Linde, John Marston and Micah Bell in
                    addition to Morgan.
                </p>
                <p> <cite> Red Dead Redemption 2 </cite> is set in an open world consisting of five American regions,
                    which
                    the player can explore as they proceed with the story, and can be played through both third-person
                    and
                    first-person view. As Arthur Morgan, players can interact with the game world in several ways,
                    including story
                    missions, side quests, challenges, randomized events, and hunting. An Honor system, returning from
                    the previous game, changes accordingly to the player's actions towards non-player characters.</p>

                <h3>Red Dead Series </h3>
                <p> The story of the Red Dead game series consists currently out of two parts.
                    The two parts, <cite> Red Dead Redemption (RDR) </cite> and <cite> Red Dead Redemption 2 </cite>,
                    are told
                    backwards.
                    So where the first game begins, the second one ends. </p>
                <p> Both titles are set in the same universe; <cite> Red Dead Redemption 2 </cite> is the prequel to
                    the first title. You will encounter younger versions of most of the characters from
                    <cite> Red Dead Redemption </cite> in the second title, given the fact that the Van der Linde Gang
                    has
                    a central role in both the storylines.
                </p>
                <p> <cite> Red Dead Redemption </cite> was set essentially in 1911. The American administration tries to
                    tame
                    the Wild West forever. Officials from the Bureau of Investigation are hoping to gather together
                    what is left of the Van der Linde Gang, who once controlled huge areas of the West and South.
                    So they extort one of the ex-members, John Marston, into chasing down three of his previous
                    confidants — Bill Williamson, Javier Escuella, and Dutch van der Linde himself.
                <p> Now twelve years in the past, <cite> Red Dead Redemption 2 </cite> follows the Van der Linde Gang
                    when it
                    was
                    at its peak in 1899. Dutch, Bill, Javier, and John are one of the group’s key members, but they
                    are not the only characters that appear in both the games.</p>
